# How Much Is Left
A mod for My Summer Car and My Winter Car that displays the contents of some items when you look at them. See currently supported items below.

## Dependencies
- [MSCLoader](https://github.com/piotrulos/MSCModLoader/releases)

## Mod Settings
Three settings for information detail are available through MSCLoader. These are:

- Show exact values (default): displays the exact amount following the units shown on the product label
- Show rough guess: shows the amount as one of three possible values (besides empty and full)
- Show educated guess: shows the amount as one of seven possible values (besides empty and full)


Countable items, like spark plugs, will always show exact values by default. If you'd like to see a guess instead, simply disable the override setting.
